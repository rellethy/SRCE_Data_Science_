# SRCE_Data_Science_
repo for SRCE's Data Science classes

I have listed some demos for SLR in multiple languages, STATA, R, and Python. If you want to use these to help get started in your Data Science journey, I'd be happy to set you on your way. As the classes progress, we can dig much deeper into what Computer science in Economics looks like!
