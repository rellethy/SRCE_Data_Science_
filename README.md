I have listed some demos for SLR,Time Series Analysis,Data Manipulation, and Data Visualization in multiple languages, STATA, R, and Python. 
As we move forward, I will continue to add more abstract data manipulation techniques in multiple languages, all in attempt to further understand and help understand. 

As you may know, Data Science is imperative to Economic Theory and its continued development. For anyone studying Economics, or any field in theoretical science, you will experience data at some point. So it's important to understand how big data and manipulation works.
